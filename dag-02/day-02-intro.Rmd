## **You will learn:**


After completing this lesson you will know how to assess:

1. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the target? 

2. How strong is the relationship between the predictors and the target?

3. Which predictors contribute to the value of the target?

4. How accurately can we estimate the effect of each predictors on the target?

5. How accurately can we predict future value od the target?

6. Is the relationship linear?

7. Is there synergy/interaction among the predictors?
